## Intro

This project was created using React and Redux to demonstrate my front-end skills.

I used my [react-redux-google-auth2](#https://github.com/iding-ir/react-redux-google-auth2) component for authentication, and [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for project backend api.

## Initialization

First, run the backend api [(json-server)](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) using command below:

```
npm run start:api
```

Once json-server is ready, run project front-end:

```
npm start
```
